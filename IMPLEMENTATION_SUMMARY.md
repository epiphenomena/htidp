# HTIDP Version 1 Implementation Summary

This implementation provides a FastAPI-based RESTful API for the HyperText ID Protocol (HTIDP) Version 1, which facilitates sharing contact information and keeping it up to date.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Token-based Exchange System**:
   - Generation of unique tokens and links for contact sharing
   - Validation and tracking of token usage

2. **VCARD Support**:
   - Standard VCARD fields (full name, organization, title, email, phone, address, website)
   - Optional additional custom fields

3. **Content Negotiation**:
   - Returns HTML or JSON based on Accept header
   - Human-friendly HTML forms for browser-based interaction
   - Machine-readable JSON for API clients

4. **Contact Exchange Process**:
   - Request token generation (`POST /v1/request-token`)
   - Exchange information retrieval (`GET /v1/exchange/{token}`)
   - Contact information exchange (`POST /v1/exchange/{token}`)
   - Contact information retrieval (`GET /v1/contact/{contact_id}`)
   - Update checking (`HEAD /v1/contact/{contact_id}`)

5. **Security Considerations**:
   - Passkey authentication framework (public key exchange)
   - Token expiration and single-use validation

## API Endpoints

- `POST /v1/request-token` - Request a new link+token for sharing contact information
- `GET /v1/exchange/{token}` - Get exchange information for a token (returns HTML or JSON based on Accept header)
- `POST /v1/exchange/{token}` - Process the exchange of contact information between servers
- `GET /v1/contact/{contact_id}` - Get contact information with passkey challenge (returns HTML or JSON based on Accept header)
- `HEAD /v1/contact/{contact_id}` - Check if contact information has changed since a timestamp
- `GET /v1/health` - Health check endpoint

## Implementation Details

- Built with Python and FastAPI for high performance and automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Follows RESTful principles
- Modular design with separate routers, models, and services
- Comprehensive test suite
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Proper error handling and validation
- Content negotiation based on Accept headers

## Future Enhancements

This implementation provides a solid foundation for HTIDP v1. Future enhancements could include:
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Full passkey authentication implementation
- Enhanced security features
- Additional VCARD field support
- Integration with existing contact management systems
